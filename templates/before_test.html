        <p>We kindly ask you to answer a few questions regarding your app ''{{ appname }}''.</p>
        <p>First, in the next page, you will be asked to map the <b>features</b> of your app with the Android activities that implement them.</p>
        <p>With the term feature we identify <i>one user-level appâ€™s functionality that realizes a functional requirement of the app from the point of view of the end user</i>.</p>
        <p>A few examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&#8226; showing the list of restaurants nearby;</li>
            <li>&#8226; sending a message to a friend;</li>
            <li>&#8226; creating a new post in a social networking app;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Afterwards, you will be asked to answer a few questions contained in a Google Form.
        The duration of the whole experiment is no more than 5-10 minutes.
